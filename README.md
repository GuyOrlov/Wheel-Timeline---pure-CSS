# ðŸ“Š Power BI DAX Wheel Timeline

A dynamic, interactive **wheel timeline** built using **pure DAX and HTML** â€” designed for **Power BI**.

---

## ðŸŒ€ What it is

This visual lets you:
- Display a **circular timeline** with years **2000â€“2025**.
- Highlight a selected year using a **slicer button** in Power BI.
- Use no JavaScript â€” itâ€™s entirely built with **DAX**, CSS custom properties, and an HTML Viewer or HTML Content custom visual.

## âœ¨ Inspired by

Originally inspired by [cbolsonâ€™s CodePen wheel timeline](https://codepen.io/cbolson/pen/vEBWwxL) â€” an elegant pure CSS demo.

I adapted the concept for Power BI to:
- Work inside a DAX measure.
- Respond dynamically to a slicer selection.
- Keep the wheel spinning effect fully inside the Power BI ecosystem.

## ðŸš€ How it works

1. **DAX Year Table**  
   Creates years from 2000 to 2025 with an index for each year.

2. **Slicer**  
   Lets you pick a year to highlight on the wheel.

3. **DAX HTML Measure**  
   Dynamically generates the HTML for the entire wheel timeline.  
   Uses `GENERATESERIES` and `CONCATENATEX` to build each `<li>` with the correct `checked` attribute.

4. **HTML Viewer**  
   Renders the final wheel timeline right in your report.
